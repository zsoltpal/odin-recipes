    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Chicken breasts are tenderised, covered in breadcrumbs and fried until golden and crispy to make this tasty German-inspired dish. It's an easy dinner everyone will love</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 small chicken breasts</li>
        <li>3 tbsp grated parmesan</li>
        <li>100g flour</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>75g dried breadcrumbs (we used panko)</li>
        <li>75ml vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place a layer of cling film on your work surface and pop the chicken fillets on top. Cover with another piece of cling film and, using a rolling pin, bash the chicken until it is 2-3mm thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put the flour on a plate and season, then put the egg on another plate. Dip the chicken in the flour to coat, then into the egg.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix together the breadcrumbs and Parmesan in a shallow bowl, then toss the chicken in the mixture to completely coat in the crumbs. Put the chicken on a plate and chill in the fridge until ready to eat if youâ€™re not cooking them straight away.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a fairly high heat and cook the chicken schnitzels two at a time. Sizzle them for 2-3 mins each side until completely golden, then lift out onto kitchen paper to drain. You can keep them warm in a low oven while you cook the rest.

    </ol>
